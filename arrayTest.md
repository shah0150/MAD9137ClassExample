```swift
Declaration and Initialization:
Declare and initialize an array called grades to store the following student grades: 95, 88, 72, 96, 78.

Accessing Elements:
What is the value at index 2 in the grades array?

Modifying Arrays:
Add the grade 84 to the end of the grades array.
Remove the grade at index 1 from the grades array.
Update the grade at index 3 to 90.

Counting Elements:
Calculate the total number of grades in the grades array.

Iterating Through Arrays:
Write a loop to print each grade in the grades array on a new line.

Sorting Arrays:
Sort the grades array in ascending order.
Sort the grades array in descending order.
Additional Methods:

Use the filter() method to create a new array called passingGrades that contains only grades above 80.

Use the map() method to multiply each element in the array by 3

use the reduce() method to calculate the total of the array

Reverse an Array:
Write Swift code to reverse the elements of the grades array in place (without creating a new array).

Print the final grades array and the passingGrades array.
```
